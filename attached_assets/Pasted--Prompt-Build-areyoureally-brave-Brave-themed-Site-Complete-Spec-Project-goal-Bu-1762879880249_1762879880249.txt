# Prompt: Build **areyoureally.brave** — Brave-themed Site (Complete Spec)

> **Project goal:** Build a responsive, accessible, contest-ready single-page site for **areyoureally.brave**. It’s an interactive 4-question quiz that evaluates the visitor’s “bravery score,” shows animated results, offers a demo Brave-wallet NFT mint flow (placeholder that connects wallet), stores result snapshots to IPFS (client or via example backend), and includes a clear “How this uses .brave” section. Design must follow Brave browser branding & theme.

## UX & Visual Design (exact specs)

* **Overall style:** Brave brand-forward, bold, modern, slightly playful but clean. Minimal clutter, large CTAs, micro-animations.
* **Primary colors (exact hex):**

  * Brave Orange / Accent: `#FB542B`
  * Deep Navy (background): `#071023` (hero gradient start)
  * Midnight Blue (background darker): `#0B1220` (hero gradient end)
  * Card / Surface: `#0F1724`
  * Muted Teal (accents): `#8EF3C5` (sparingly)
  * Text primary: `#E6F0EF`
  * Text secondary: `#C9E8DF`
  * Subtle border / divider: `rgba(255,255,255,0.06)`
* **Typography:**

  * System stack + Inter recommended. CSS: `font-family: 'Inter', system-ui, -apple-system, "Segoe UI", Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Arial;`
  * Headline sizes: H1 = 34px (desktop), 28px (mobile). H2 = 20–22px.
  * Body text: 16px (desktop), 15px (mobile). Line height ~1.45.
* **Spacing & layout:**

  * Centered hero card, max-width `900px`, padding `28px` desktop / `18px` mobile.
  * Rounded corners `14px`–`16px` on cards.
  * Subtle drop shadow: `0 8px 30px rgba(2,6,23,0.6)`.
* **Hero background:**

  * Use a **diagonal gradient**: `linear-gradient(135deg, #071023 0%, #0B1220 60%)`.
  * Add a very subtle noise overlay or animated star particles for depth (low CPU).
* **Buttons:**

  * Primary CTA: filled with `#FB542B`, white text, border-radius `10px`, padding `12px 18px`, font-weight `600`.
  * Secondary (ghost): transparent with `1px` border `rgba(255,255,255,0.08)`.
  * Hover states: slight scale `transform: translateY(-2px)` + box-shadow increase.
* **Animations & microinteractions:**

  * Quiz transitions: slide/fade for question changes (`.3s` ease).
  * Result reveal: pulse + confetti (small, subtle) when score is high.
  * Buttons: smooth `transition: all .18s ease`.
* **Accessibility:**

  * Color contrast: ensure body text vs background meets AA (check with the chosen colors).
  * Keyboard navigable: quiz inputs tabbable, visible focus ring `outline: 3px solid rgba(251,84,43,0.22)`.
  * `aria-live` region for dynamic result text.

## Functional Requirements (behaviors)

1. **Quiz flow**

   * 4 multiple-choice questions, each with 2–4 choices.
   * Show progress (e.g., `Question 2 of 4`) and a progress bar.
   * Each question stores a numeric bravery score (0–2 per question, configurable).
   * After the final answer, show:

     * Score (e.g., `3/4`)
     * Result badge text (e.g., `You Are Brave`, `Bold Beginner`, `Cautious Explorer`) with short constructive copy (~1–2 lines).
     * Animated badge SVG (also host on IPFS).
2. **Wallet connect (demo)**

   * Use `window.ethereum` EIP-1193 to request accounts. If Brave Wallet is detected, prompt connect.
   * On successful connect: show connected address (shortened), change “Mint Badge” button to “Mint (demo)”.
   * Provide clear comments in code where to plug a real mint contract call (ABI, contract address placeholder).
3. **Mint flow (demo)**

   * If wallet connected, clicking Mint performs a simulated transaction flow:

     * Prepare metadata JSON (title, score, date, CID of snapshot if available).
     * If doing a real mint is too heavy, simulate by signing a message with `eth_signTypedData` and show “Mint request signed (demo)”.
     * Provide code comments and one example `mintBadge()` function stub that demonstrates a real `contract.methods.mint(...)` call for an ERC-721 contract (pseudo-code).
4. **IPFS snapshot (recommended)**

   * On result, allow user to “Save result to IPFS” which:

     * Converts a small HTML or JSON snapshot + badge image to a file and uploads to web3.storage / nft.storage (client example), returning a CID.
     * If user chooses not to input API key, fallback: show instruction to run the included `upload-to-ipfs.js` Node script locally with API key.
   * Show resulting `ipfs://CID` and copy button. Also show preview link `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/CID`.
5. **Share & Meta**

   * Deep-link result: append `#result=<encoded>` to the URL so result can be shared and parsed on page load.
   * Add Open Graph meta tags for title, description, and image (image could be `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<placeholderCID>`).
6. **About & How it uses .brave**

   * Short section explaining: “Hosted on IPFS. Domain resolution via .brave on Polygon naming system. Brave wallet support for minting & identity.”
7. **Footer**

   * Links: `vibecheck.brave`, `highkey.brave`, `sigmaboy.brave` (just anchors or real links if you deploy).
   * Short contest disclosure: “Built for .brave Site-Building Challenge — live on-chain.”

## Technical Stack & Files

* **Plain HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS** preferred for minimal weight. Optional: small build with Vite if you prefer modular code.
* **Suggested libraries** (keep minimal):

  * `@metamask/detect-provider` (optional), or use raw `window.ethereum`.
  * `ipfs-http-client` OR web3.storage JS client (example usage).
  * `tiny-confetti` or a small confetti function (no heavy libs).
  * No UI frameworks (no React) unless you want to use a prebuilt Replit template — if using React, include Vite + optimized build.
* **File structure (single-page, but split for clarity):**

  ```
  areyoureally/
  ├─ index.html
  ├─ styles.css
  ├─ app.js
  ├─ assets/
  │  ├─ badge.svg
  │  ├─ hero-illustration.svg
  │  └─ small-noise.png (optional)
  ├─ ipfs/
  │  └─ upload-to-ipfs.js   # node example using web3.storage (requires API key)
  └─ README.md
  ```
* **index.html**: include meta tags for mobile, OG tags, theme-color (`#FB542B`).
* **styles.css**: full design tokens and utility classes; responsive breakpoints: `<= 768px` mobile.
* **app.js**: all interactive logic (quiz state, wallet connect, ipfs upload functions, share link parse, accessibility announcements).

## Deployment & Replit-specific instructions

1. **Replit template choice**

   * Use the static site template (HTML/CSS/JS) or Node static server if you want the upload script to run server-side.
2. **Local commands** (if using Node for upload script):

   * `npm init -y`
   * `npm i web3.storage ipfs-http-client` (choose one upload approach)
   * Create `.env` with `WEB3_STORAGE_API_KEY=your_key_here` (do not commit).
3. **Running locally on Replit**

   * If static: Replit serves `index.html` automatically.
   * If Node: `node server.js` or use `npm start` (define in `package.json`).
4. **Testing in Brave**

   * Open the Replit URL in Brave Desktop and Brave Mobile (if available).
   * Test wallet flows: Brave will prompt to connect wallet; ensure EIP-1193 requests work.
   * Test share link: copy the `#result=...` link and open in private window.
5. **IPFS upload**

   * For client-side web3.storage upload: create a tiny UI that asks for API key (dangerous), or provide a separate `upload-to-ipfs.js` script that runs on dev machine with API key in `.env`.
   * Example `upload-to-ipfs.js` usage (node):

     ```bash
     node ipfs/upload-to-ipfs.js ./snapshot.json
     # returns CID printed to console
     ```
6. **Pointing to .brave**

   * After upload, you’ll receive a CID. Use Unstoppable Domains dashboard → select domain → Set Content → paste `ipfs://<CID>` (or the CID hash in their content field). Save.
   * Wait a few minutes, then open `https://areyoureally.brave/` in Brave to verify.

## Dev Notes & Implementation Tips (include in code comments)

* Keep JS modular but avoid heavy bundlers. If using bundler, ensure final build is under ~2MB total.
* For walletflow: check if `window.ethereum?.isBraveWallet` to show Brave-specific hints.
* Error handling: show clear messages for `wallet not found`, `signature rejected`, `IPFS upload failed`.
* Security: do NOT hardcode any private keys or web3.storage API keys in the client. Provide a server script as an approved method to upload if needed.
* Performance: lazy-load badge SVG with `loading="lazy"`, compress images, use optimized SVGs.
* Analytics: optional — include a small share / social CTA so People’s Choice judges can find it. But do not add third-party trackers that might violate contest rules.
